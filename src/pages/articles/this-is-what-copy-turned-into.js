            <p>Yesterday I visited the Educate website.</p>
            <p>You know, Iman Gadzhi's new courses...</p>
            <p>
              I wanted to check out the copy of the website, but something
              caught my eye.
            </p>
            <p>There was a course on copywriting.</p>
            <p>"Pen to Profit"</p>
            <p>Hmm, pretty good name.</p>
            <p>
              So I checked the description, and this is where everything went
              sideways...
            </p>
            <p>
              Just for some context, I have no problem with Iman, I like the
              guy.
            </p>
            <p>Even tho recently he started turning into more of a guru.</p>
            <p>But, anyway...</p>
            <p>I noticed two things straight away. Well, two sentences...</p>
            <p className="bold">"proven fill-in-the-blanks copy structure"</p>
            <p>Oof.</p>
            <p className="bold">
              "you'll learn how to use A.I. to get all the copy written for you"
            </p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Iman.</p>
            <p>WTF</p>
            <p>Every decent copywriter knows that the first one is total BS.</p>
            <p>Only those use it who don't want to do the real work.</p>
            <p>
              Because for every market, every situation, and every time you need
              different copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Copy that worked in the health niche, is not going to work in the
              fitness niche.
            </p>
            <p>Or copy that worked 10 years ago, isn't going to work now.</p>
            <p>
              It might convert, but you would have way better results with copy
              researched and written now.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>And coming onto the second point...</p>
              <p>
                This one caused a lot of controversy recently in the copywriting
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everybody is scared of losing their job. And every other guru is
                trying to sell some kind of prompt bundle.
              </p>
              <p>
                You probably heard this a thousand times before, so I will keep
                it short:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Can A.I. write copy?</h4>
                  <p>Yep.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Can it write good copy?</h4>
                  <p>Nope.</p>
                  <p>
                    It won't be able to write copy that takes into account
                    awareness and sophistication levels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And those are just two things, there is a lot more going
                    into good copy.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Will it steal your job?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Nope. Unless you write criminal copy. In case you do...
                    hurry up and become good.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Do I use A.I.?</h4>
                  <p>Yes, I use it.</p>
                  <p>I do use A.I. for general research and sometimes ideas.</p>
                  <p>But never for writing.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Okay, that was enough of a rant for today...</p>
              <p>'Till next time</p>
